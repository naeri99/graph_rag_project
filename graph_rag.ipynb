      "As Orestes grew to manhood, he was destined to take revenge on Aegisthus for his father's murder, representing both a filial duty and a demand for justice. When Orestes reached maturity, he fulfilled this obligation by killing Aegisthus in revenge, completing the cycle of retribution. This act of vengeance was not only expected but praised, as Orestes was commended for killing his father's murderer and restoring honor to his family.\n",

      "The relationship exemplifies the classical theme of blood vengeance, where Aegisthus' crime against Orestes' father created an inescapable destiny of retribution. Aegisthus' role as the killer made him the target of justified revenge, while Orestes' role as the son made him the instrument of divine and familial justice. Their relationship demonstrates how violence begets violence in the heroic age, but also how the restoration of justice through righteous vengeance could be celebrated as a noble"
