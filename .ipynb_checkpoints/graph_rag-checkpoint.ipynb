He is the husband of Penelope and father of Telemachus, who sailed to Troy along with the flower of the Argives and played a crucial role in sacking the famous city. Before the war, Ulysses made burnt sacrifices to propitiate the gods and was known for being the most liberal in his offerings to the immortals, earning their recognition as the most capable man on earth.\n",

However, he has become trapped on a lonely sea-girt island, kept away from his friends and home by a goddess, making him a suffering hero who has grown tired of life. The gods have hidden him away more closely than any mortal man, though it is their will that he should eventually return home. His current fate remains uncertain - his bones may be rotting in the wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf, or he may be a prisoner among savages on some distant island.\n",

These men feast at his expense and would flee in terror if he were to return, as he would deal harshly with them using his many spears that are kept in the spear-stand. His house, which once welcomed many visitors, now suffers under the suitors' destructive presence.\n",

His son Telemachus, inspired by Minerva's counsel, now seeks to discover his father's fate through a planned journey, while his wife Penelope continues to mourn her lost husband who, like many other men, never returned from the Trojan War.
